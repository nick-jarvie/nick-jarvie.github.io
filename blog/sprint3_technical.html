            <b>The differences between HTML and CSS</b>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the basic building blocks of the Web. It is how we define and structure web content.</p>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that controls how webpages look. The browser applies CSS style to specified elements, which determines how a webpage is displayed.</p>
            <p>If we were to use an analogy, like making a movie. The HTML would be the base script for the film, the CSS would be the costuming, set design and special effects and the director would be JavaScript deciding how the film is shot, performed and edited together.</p>
            <b>Control flow and loops</b>
            <p>Control flow is the order in which the computer performs and then executes code. Unless it comes across structures that change the flow such as loops. Loops in JavaScript are a simple and quick way to repeat a task until a specified result is reached.</p>
            <p>Let’s use another analogy, you are working in a restaurant kitchen and are preparing a meal (steak and veggies). The control flow is the recipe you follow in order to make the dish. One loop would be when you begin cooking the steak. You will keep cooking the steak until it reaches the state the customer has requested, in this case medium rare.</p>
            <b>What is the DOM?</b>
            <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) interacts with any HTML or XML document through your browser. It represents the document as a node tree, so every element, text or attribute are broken down into nodes at the end of a branch, essentially modularising the website. This then allows code running in your browser to easily read and interact with it, letting the user change and manipulate the document's structure, style and content.</p>
            <b>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays vs objects?</b>
            <p>Objects are often used to represent a collection of related data, for example information about a person’s characteristics. These characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value i.e.  age: 44,<br>Properties within objects can be accessed and changed by using dot or bracket notation. </p>
            <p>Whereas Arrays are often used to store a list of multiple items within a single variable, such as a ordered collection of birthdates in a given month. The collection can then be accessed by their numerical position in the list, however Arrays use zero-based indexing, which means the first item in an array has an index of 0, while the second item has an index of 1, and so on.</p>
            <b>What are functions? Why are they useful?</b>
            <p>A Function is a group of code that can be called on and reused to perform a specific task. When the functions name is called, the specified argument’s will be passed through the code stored between the functions brackets and a value may be returned. Functions are useful because it helps to reduce the need for duplicate code as you can use the same function on multiple value sets. </p>
