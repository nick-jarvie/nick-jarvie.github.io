            <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
            <p>
            <b>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
            </b>
            <p>
            With everything going in the world at the moment as a result of covid19, I thought it might be good to try and reflect on something more recent that has some relevance.
            I recently travelled to Japan during March, arriving back on the 24th the day before level 4 lockdown. 
            I guess the ethical decision that ties into this comes from trying to weigh up the information I had on hand before leaving. Then trying to make a judgement call on whether or not it would be safe to travel at this time, both for myself and others. 
            I was traveling by myself so I would be responsible only for myself and those I meet along the way. I decided to travel, as at the time the numbers reported in Japan were very low relative to the size of Japan and other parts of the world. 
            While traveling I tried to take as many health and safety precautions as possible in regards to handwashing, wearing of masks etc. 
            It wasn’t until about half through my trip that things started to change back home and further develop around the world. With some last minute flight changes and restrictions coming into place, I was still able to get home in time. Arriving back and reflecting, I think that I took as many of the necessary precautions as I could with the information that was available at the time.

            <b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
            </b>
            <p>
            I’m from Wellington, New Zealand and have spent most of life in this area. I went to an all-boys school in the Hutt were I played hockey and was fortunate enough to be involved in sports trips to both Malaysia and China. I studied design at Massey university, worked in a design studio for a bit before beginning to freelance. 
            I think a lot of my values and identity stem from having a strong and supportive family, a solid foundation that are willing to help and provide practical ideas and solutions, I really enjoy working with others which may stem from my time playing sport. I’m usually pretty easy going and people say I am a calm point of reference. I can be a little reserved and quiet at times as I really value listening to other and the input they have. I enjoy and really value traveling, learning new things and meeting people who can offer new perspectives.

            <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations</h3>
            <p>
            <b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. (strengths and limitations?)  
            </b>
            <p>
            I think a lot of my strengths are a result of my family and education, I think my family has always pushed me to learn new skills and try new things and my history in art and design has helped me to be more detail orientated. The amount of effort I put into projects could be a result of team sports and being a part of a close family and always trying to put in my fair share. I think I can be a little reserved at times as I always trusted those around me and felt content listening to others. I tend to procrastinate the things I’m unsure about as I’m always wanting the things I make or do to be of a certain quality. I also tend to be my biggest critic and am usually the first to point out any flaws.

            <b>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
            </b>
            <p>
            When I find a part of a project or assignment that really interests and engages me, I will tend to really focus in on that element and try to make it as good as possible. Motivating me to learn more about it, so I can really wrap my head around it and produce the best result. Conversely when I reach I point of frustration, or struggle with something I can be tempted to take a break, to revaluate it, which can lead to me further procrastinating and not putt the time needed into the things I sometimes struggle with. 
            </p>
            <b>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
            </b>
            <p>
            When I focus in on one specific element of a project it often creates one part that is really well resolved, but can be to the detriment of the other elements I find less appealing. Aspects that in many regards may be more important for me to focus on, in order to experience, learn and grow my skillset for the future. I enjoy solving problems and finding solutions and so can sometimes be slow to speak up and ask for help, which can sometimes lead to frustration. Resulting in me not enjoying a particular aspect and perhaps not giving it my full attention.  
            </p>
            <b>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
            </b>
            <p>
            When I was studying design at university it was pretty common that a lot of our assignments were group projects in order to help prepare us for real world working environments. For the most part there weren’t too many issues and people were happy and willing to contribute towards the project. But there were one or two cases where someone in the group was either not interested, couldn’t be bothered or contributing the bare minimum to the project. In those instances it was a matter of finding out why they weren’t contributing, finding a part they could engage with or actually interested them, or helping to delegate them smaller tasks that they could complete more easily. Looking back I’m not sure how different I would approach it, so often in university it’s the immense workload that can overload people. I think the best method is clear communication and talking to the other person about what they are struggling and what measures we can be taken to ease tensions.
