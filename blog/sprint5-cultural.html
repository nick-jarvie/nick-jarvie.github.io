            <b>Reflection</b><br><br>
            <b>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b>
            <p>
                1.	The value of reflection, both self-reflection in terms of self-awareness and  knowing your own strengths and limitations. But also technical reflection and how they both help to retain and absorb new ideas.<br>
                2.	How disappointing it can be when you can’t wrap your head around a concept or solve a problem and knowing the effect it can have on my attitude.<br>
                3.	Sometimes having to really force myself to have a growth mindset when I’m struggling with a concept or problem.                
            </p>
            <b>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</b>
            <p>
                I think self-awareness plays an important role in your ability to reflect and be introspective as well as how clearly you see yourself in relation to others. Empathy is often tied very closely with your capacity to learn and apply critical thinking skills, along with the importance and respect you place on learning from others shared expertise, experiences and values.
            </p>
            <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>
            <p>
                I think one of the things that has surprised me the most is the value of reflection, both in terms of self-reflection and reflection on the technical side of learning. I often found it very helpful in alleviating some of my unease or uncertainty about a problem or topic I was unsure about. This along with the ideas of neuroplasticity and having a growth mindset have really helped when I have been overwhelmed by all of the new concepts.
            </p>
            <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>
            <p>
                One of the more challenging aspects of the core learning was coming to terms with and understanding what some of my own strengths and limitations are. Then using the methods covered under the core leaning to help work on those weaknesses through things like scheduling, goal setting, breaking down problems, mindfulness and understanding your  mindset.
            </p>
            <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</b>
            <p>
                I think they are important skills, especially when working in groups and with others in the workplace. Your ability to communicate, value and empathies with those around is often a good measure of someone’s emotional intelligence and often indicative of how well someone can inspire, lead and motivate others.
            </p>
            <b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</b>
            <p>
                No, I think a lot of the skills are not only valuable in day to day life and in the workplace but are useful in helping us understand why and how you feel and act a certain way. I think the ability to understand your values, yourself and those around you is instrumental in being a positive and effective member your community. 
            </p>
            <b>Preparing for Bootcamp</b><br><br>
            <b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b>
            <p>
                I’m attending Dev Academy because I enjoy creative problem solving and I’m looking forward to learning some new skills that mesh well with my current design skill set to hopefully expand future career opportunities. I don’t have any long term goals set in stone, but something that mixes both design and web development would be very appealing.               
            </p>
            <b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b>
            <p>
                Attention to detail:<br>
                While I have a good eye for visual details, it’s been hard transferring this skill to something less visually focused and more structurally focused.<br><br>
                
                Thoughtfulness and respect:<br>
                I think this will be extremely important during bootcamp, to be considerate of those around me and give everyone their due respect.<br><br>
                
                Listening and receiving feedback:<br>
                During bootcamp I think it will be crucial to be open to new ideas and perspectives, as well as receiving and incorporating advice or feedback from students and teachers alike.<br><br>
                
                Calmness:<br>
                I have no doubt I will probably be stressed and frustrated at many points during the bootcamp, so I think it will important to be mindful and self-aware enough to know when to take a break.<br><br>
                
                Introvert:<br>
                I think it will be important to speak up, question and ask for help or support when needed, even though I initial might be a little resistant.<br><br>
                
                Procrastination:<br>
                I think time management and planning will be key to ensuring everything remains on schedule and to ensure I am making the most of my time at EDA.<br><br>
                
                Biggest critic:<br>
                During bootcamp I think it will be important to not be too critical of my work and maintain a growth mindset throughout, don’t get too hung up on perfectionism.<br><br>
                
            </p>
            <b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</b>
            <p>
                Ensuring I don’t get burnt out and look after and maintain my own mental health.
                It will be important to plan and manage my time and ensure that if I do get stuck I follow the suggested problem solving and support guidelines.                
            </p>
            <b>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</b>
            <p>
                Good communication skills, especially with a bunch of strangers or people I have never worked with before. As a bit of an introvert it can often be a bit of a hurdle to build a fast rapport with a new person or team member. So being able to develop those skills would be one of my priorities.
            </p>
            <b>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</b>
            <p>
                To be present and willing to learn and grow. To put in the extra time and work to get the best result. To be open and clear communicating with peers and teachers. To work in a respectful manner that is hopefully reflected by the students and facilitators within the program.
