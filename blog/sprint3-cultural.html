            <b>What is Emotional Intelligence?
            </b>
            <p>
            Emotional intelligence is someone’s ability to identify emotions. It is how well people are able to evaluate and perceive how someone else feels. While also being a measure of how well they control and express their own emotions. It is also how they use their emotions to relate to others and interact in social settings.
            </p>
            <b>How is it different to IQ?
            </b>
            <p>
            IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is traditionally used to determine ones academic ability and is usually derived from a standardized test to assess intelligence. IQ is often indicative of someone’s ability to solve a challenging task, analyse, reason and recall information. 
            <br>Whereas someone’s emotional intelligence is more their ‘soft’ skills or their ability to identify, assess and control their own and others emotions alone and in a group.
            </p>
            <b>Why is it important?
            </b>
            <p>
            Someone’s emotional intelligence can often be a measure of how well they look after their own physical and mental health. Their ability to manage effective relationships and even their ability to inspire and lead. It can be a measure for ones capacity to motivate, communicate and be empathic to others. In some ways it can be an indication of ones well-being, fulfilment and overall happiness.
