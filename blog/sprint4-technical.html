            <b>A story about </b><br><br>
            <b>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem?</b>
            <p>
              I was working on a problem where I had to code a function that would find multiples of 3, 5 and 15 in a set of numbers and then assign those multiples three different words (Fizz, Buzz or Fizzbuzz). I had already made the function to find the specified numbers and return the associated words. But I was struggling to figure out how to pass the set (array) of numbers into that function.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had tried writing some pseudocode and breaking down what I had to do step by step, but I couldn’t quite wrap my head around exactly what I had to do, I then tried googling and looking at some other solutions online as well as at the supplied solution. Once I had looked at a few other methods and solutions, I would then try and reverse engineer it, until I understood what was going on and what steps I would have to take. It turns out I just had to use a ‘for loop’ to pass the numbers from the supplied array through my FizzBuzz function. That would then equate them to the new array I had made, which would return the new set.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the beginning I was excited to try and solve the problem. That was then followed by a lot of frustration when I was not sure what to do next. Then some relief once I had spent some time trying to understand other solutions and methods and begun to understand what I needed to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              What did I learn? That if you get stuck on a problem, chances are someone else out there has gone through a similar thing. So there is probably a solution out there you can break down, understand and implement that will also fit your own problem. 
            </p>
            <b>Tell your non tech friend a story about a time you solved a problem in an elegant way?</b>
            <p>
              Not sure if it was really elegant, but I was working on the same problem where I had to code a function that would find multiples of 3, 5 and 15 in a set of numbers and then assign those multiples three different words (Fizz, Buzz or Fizzbuzz). 
            </p>
            <p>
              But in this half of the problem I had a clearer idea of what to do, I knew a pretty straight forward way to solve it would be using an if/else statement. So I wrote out the steps I would need to take in pseudocode as well as breaking down the correct code I would have to use. I would often try and break now each of the steps into more complete sentences in the pseudocode almost as if I was explaining it to another person that was not familiar with it, to help ensure I fully understood each of the steps.  
            </p>
            <p>
              It was reassuring to be able to breakdown half of the problem and understand what I needed to do, and really helped me realise that writing down and creating a plan of how you are going to tackle a problem can lead to you more clearly understanding it. 
            </p>
            <b>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</b><br><br>
            <b>Pseudocode: 8/10</b>
            <p>
              Pseudocode is usually the first technique I will try and so far I have found it really helpful when solving a new problem. 
            </p>
            <b>Trying something: 5/10</b>
            <p>
              More often than not I feel like I don’t yet have the necessary insight or I’m not sure of the right method to solve it straight away. But as I get more confident in my ability, I’m hoping that will change.
            </p>
            <b>Rubber ducky method: 5/10</b>
            <p>
              At the moment I have almost been using pseudocode as a stand in for a rubber ducky and have been trying to explain my thought process within that, then reading it back aloud.
            </p>
            <b>Reading error messages: 6/10</b>
            <p>
              Have been trying to use it more and more but sometimes it’s a matter of me still not knowing what the error is pointing to exactly.
            </p>
            <b>Console.logging: 7/10</b>
            <p>Have found it helpful so far but I know I should probably be using more than I currently have been.</p>
            <b>Googling: 8/10</b>
            <p>
              Probably the process I use the most when I don’t understand a concept or problem.
            </p>
            <b>Asking your peers for help: n/a</b>
            <p>
              Have not really relied on this so far, I’m sure everyone would be more than happy to help. But so far I have gravitated towards the other methods before this one. Something to improve upon.
            </p>
            <b>Asking coaches for help: 8/10</b>
            <p>
              Have been really helpful and there have been a few instances where I have reached out to my facilitator for some guidance and clarification throughout the sprints.
            </p>
            <b>Improving your process with reflection: 8/10</b>
            <p>
              Something that has been really useful so far, especially in trying to retain so much new content within a short amount of time.
            </p>
