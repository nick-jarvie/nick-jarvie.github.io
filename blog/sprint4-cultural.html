            <b>Neuroplasticity</b><br><br>
            <b>Discuss how understanding the principals of neuroplasticity benefits people</b>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways throughout a person’s life, more specificity it is when the neurons and neural networks of your brain change their connections as a result of new information and stimulation. Repeated stimulation of the same networks helps to strengthen the pathway. So the more a person performs a task the easier they will be able to recall or perform that activity in the future.</p>
            <b>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</b>
            <p>The more I practice an activity, in this case coding, the easier it should be to perform in the future. Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing material in a variety of ways helps to build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections. It also helps to put information into context and prioritise activities that help to tap into already-existing pathways.</p>
            <b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</b>
            <p>I think some of the best ways to increase my own neuroplasticity is to engage with a lot of the methods we have touched on already throughout the sprints. Such as having a defined and consistent schedule and getting enough sleep. Setting clear and meaningful goals, taking small and important steps in learning and adopting a growth mindset. Practicing mindfulness, exercising and raising your standards and to stop procrastinating.</p>
            <b>Growth Mindset</b><br><br>
            <b>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</b>
            <p>A mindset is the way we approach and deal with a particular situation.<br>A Growth Mindset is understanding that skills and abilities can be improved through persistence and work rather than being a fixed trait.</p>
            <b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b>
            <p>That you can be both mindsets and often switch between them. I think I particularly related to this point as in the past there have definitely been times when I have been less confident and thus less inclined to learn but others when I have been the opposite.</p>
            <b>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</b>
            <p>I think proving to myself in small steps that I’m capable of developing both my skillset and mindset will be very important as I continue working through the material, most of which is new to me. So I think maintaining the “not yet” attitude as I encounter any problems and embracing the challenge and difficulty will be an important aspect in my learning journey.</p>
