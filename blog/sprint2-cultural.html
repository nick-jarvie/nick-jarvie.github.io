            <b>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?
            </b>
            <p>
            I have been a freelance designer for the last few years and although I enjoy a lot of aspects of design work I’m attending Dev Academy because I enjoy creative problem solving and I’m looking forward to learning some new skills that mesh well with my current design skill set to hopefully expand future career opportunities. I don’t have any long term goals set in stone, but something that mixes both design and web development would be very appealing.
            </p>
            <b>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
            </b>
            <p>
            Good communication skills, especially with a bunch of strangers or people I have never worked with before. As a bit of an introvert it can often be a bit of a hurdle to build a fast rapport with a new person or team member. So being able to develop those skills would be one of my priorities.
            </p>
            <b>A description of your own strengths and limitations
            </b>
            <p>
                Attention to detail<br> 
                I have a good eye for smaller details and my design experience has helped to shape that in a practical direction.<br>
                <br>
                Thoughtfulness and respect<br>
                I always try to be considerate of those around me and give everyone their due respect.<br>
                <br>
                Listening and receiving feedback<br> 
                I always open to new ideas and perspectives, if that is in terms of advice or feedback then I am always happy to listen and implement what is needed.<br>
                <br>
                Calmness<br>
                I am pretty easy going and so when things are going wrong it can really take a lot to phase or frustrate me.<br>
                <br>
                Introvert<br>
                I like to keep to myself and am often more comfortable listening to others than taken charge.<br>
                <br>
                Procrastination<br>
                I tend to put the things I don’t enjoy off until the last minute.<br>
                <br>
                Biggest critic<br>
                I am usually the first to point out any flaws in my own work.<br>

            <b>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.  
            </b>
            <p>
            Perhaps the most important aspect will be time management and planning, not focusing in on any one detail and ensuring that if I do get stuck I follow the suggested problem solving guidelines. And to reach out and ask a facilitator if needed. It’s also important to adhere to the guidelines set out in the EDA student handbook and treat others in the program with the same respect that I expect from them.
            </p>
            <b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
            </b>
            <p>
            If the workload or something else arises in which I need help or guidance. Then it’s important that I get in contact with one of the course facilitators or whoever is most suited in helping me in that situation. Also when the help is needed, not to leave it till the last moment.
            </p>
            <b>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
            </b>
            <p>
            To be present and willing to help and inform in whichever way they feel is most suitable, and to work in a respectful manner that is hopefully reflected by the students within the program.
            </p>
            <b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
            </b>
            <p>
            Currently this course is my sole focus and other activities, events or work will be secondary. Unless in cases of unexpected or unforeseen events that need immediate attention.
